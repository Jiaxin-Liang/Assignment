2.White-box testing

    This program uses a testing framework called "MinUnit" to conduct white box testing.
    The framework test parser functions by comparing the output of unit functions with the expected ones automatically.
    Use different samples of .ttl programs in break-samples directory to test if a specific function is stable.

    A MinUnit test case is a minimal unit test framework for C.
    It is just a function that returns 0 (null) if the tests pass.
    If the test fails, the function should return a string describing the failing test.
    The mu_assert is simply a macro that returns a string if the expression passed to it is false.
    The mu_runtest macro calls another test case and returns if that test case fails.
